## Couch Potato Telegram Bot

This project attempts to marry Telegram's Bot API with Couch Potato's API to allow someone to send commands through Telegram to Couch Potato to do things such as add movies to a download queue.

This is currently a work-in-progress (though it does work).

Requirements:
* Node.js (Haven't tested with < 7)
* Redis (For caching movie information)

To-dos:
* Create a Docker deployment strategy
* Support more commands
* Much better documentation
* Package it up and make it useable for less technical people
